#TCP Server
# This server handles TCP packets. That means it handles 
# all the data that must be received and must be received in order. 
# Think of things like players joining, chat messages, players leaving, activating thruters, etc. 
# It does NOT handle streaming the positions of objects. Instead, that is the Streaming Server, which uses UDP.
