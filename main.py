# Running this file with Python should set up your server :)

#   You're talking a look at the code behind space agency 2!
#   If you're just trying to change game settings, it's easier to 
#   Just edit config.txt. Editing the code here is great for 
#   creating mods and community contributions, but keep in mind
#   that this will affect all of your games, and harmful edits
#   may result in being rejected for or losing your Hyder trust key.
